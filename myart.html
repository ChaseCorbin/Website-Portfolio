This was my first pen artwork, as I drew more with pen I learned to not worry about mistakes. You should rather use that mistake to generate creative natural abstractions. It adds alot to the natural aspect when you allow mistakes to happen.</p>

The lemon blocks some light that passes through the middle (pulp and pitch) of the fruit changing its value and intensity. The front face you are viewing is not dark because of reflecting light from behind the perspective.</p>

This is due to lack of photons reflecting from the surface behind the glass. It was an interesting physics inspired study of light. I grew a large interest as I studied the double slit experirement.</p>

                            <h1>Embossing thick paper.</h1>
                            <p>I learned after many years that embossing thick heavy-weighted paper that is smooth can create extreme highlights. This can be controlled if done correctly without destroying your paper. The idea is to score the paper in a way to allow the white paper underneath to not be drawn over. This allows perfect highlights for fir textures in some cases.</p>

                            <p>This is the most recent illustration I have produced, my fiance and I enjoy painting with watercolor as a way to relax. This allows us to find creative inspiration. I have enjoyed exploring the many beautiful ways to control value and color using this medium.</p>
