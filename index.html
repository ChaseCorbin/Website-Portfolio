            <p>I have recently graduated from Southern Crescent Technical College with an associate degree in computer networking. I aspire to learn about technology and using it in many ways to express my creativity. Front-end web development has been a passion of mine for many years, I began learning code in high school. Since then, I have further refined my programming skills; you can view my GitHub as a reference to my progression.</p>

                <p class="p-tile-3">I currently work as an IT Support Specialist for Southern Crescent Technical College, where I have also worked as a tutor for several years. I tutored various concepts of math, such as Algebra, Statistics, etc. I also tutored numerous students in proper syntax for front end Web Development. Currently, I configure, deploy, and maintain different endpoint devices for Southern Crescents’ IT infrastructure.</p>

                <p class="p-tile-3">My creative passion for art began at a young age. I was about eight years old when I started to grow interest in the different complexities of shading with a graphite pencil. After mastering contrast with a pencil, I decided to use more color in my art. This was achieved through mixing different mediums. I had a great desire for hyper-realism until I reached high school. During my high school years at Pike County High School, I learned 2D & 3D graphic design using various software services.</p>
                <p class="p-tile-3" style="margin-bottom: 4em;">I also expressed a strong desire for Web Development using languages such as, HTML5 and CSS3. After high school I decided to attend West Georgia in the computer science field of study. After a semester I chose to switch colleges and shift to a new field of study in computer networking at Southern Crescent Technical College. Here I finished my Associates while Tutoring students in Math/HTML/CSS/JS and many other concepts. Shortly after graduating in December 2021, I was offered a position as an IT Support Specialist in January 2022. As an IT Support Specialist I configure, deploy, and maintain a large Windows environment containing windows server features such as AD, WSUS, WDS, etc.</p>
